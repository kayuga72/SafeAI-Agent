# 🗺️ SafeAI-Agent Roadmap

Welcome to the development roadmap for SafeAI-Agent — a transparent, ethical AI assistant for PC safety.  
This document outlines the key phases, goals, and contributor roles to guide our open-source journey.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Proof-of-Concept (Now Live)
✅ Process monitoring module  
⬜ File monitoring module  
⬜ Network monitoring module  
⬜ Basic AI explanation layer  

Goal: Build a minimal working agent that scans processes and flags suspicious activity.

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: Intelligence & Explanation
⬜ Expand detection rules (e.g. file types, network patterns)  
⬜ Add plain-language AI explanations for alerts  
⬜ Create a feedback loop to improve detection  

Goal: Help users understand what’s happening and why — no jargon, just clarity.

---

## 🖥️ Phase 3: User Interface
⬜ Build a simple dashboard (console or GUI)  
⬜ Show alerts, logs, and recommended actions  
⬜ Add toggle options for modules (process/file/network)

Goal: Make the agent usable for non-technical users.

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: Digital Workflow Expansion
⬜ Social media agent (post scheduling, spam filtering)  
⬜ Email assistant (scan attachments, detect phishing)  
⬜ Browser extension (flag risky downloads or sites)

Goal: Extend SafeAI-Agent into everyday digital life.

---

## 🧩 Phase 5: Agent Studio (Long-Term Vision)
⬜ Visual builder for custom agents  
⬜ Drag-and-drop modules (monitoring, alerts, automation)  
⬜ Export/share your own agent setup

Goal: Empower anyone — no coding required — to build their own safe AI assistant.
