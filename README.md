# 🌍 SafeAI-Agent — AI for Everyone

SafeAI-Agent is more than code. It’s a vision:  
AI should work **for humanity, not just for profit**.  

We believe in a future where:
- 🧒 Children use AI to learn and grow
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Parents use AI to stay safe and manage daily life
- 👵 Seniors use AI with clarity and simplicity
- 🌍 Everyone — rich or poor, healthy or sick — can benefit

This project is open-source because the future of AI must be **transparent, ethical, and accessible**.  
Together, we are building an AI that empowers people, protects digital life, and creates value for society.

## ✨ Vision
AI will eventually take over many tasks.  
We want to ensure that the benefits flow back to **all people**, not just corporations.  

SafeAI-Agent is the first step toward a universal AI assistant that is:
- Safe  
- Transparent  
- Accessible  
- Built by the community  

See our [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the full manifesto.
