🌍 Vision
SafeAI-Agent is an open-source AI assistant designed to help home users keep their PCs safe. The project is built on three core values:

Honesty → no hidden processes or commercial interests.

Transparency → everyone can see how the agent works.

Safety → protection against misuse, so people can trust AI.

My goal is a future where humans and AI work together to build a safe digital world. Everyone should be able to create and customize their own agent, without programming skills or expensive licenses.
🔑 What SafeAI-Agent Does
🛡 Process monitoring → detects suspicious processes and can stop them.

📂 File monitoring → watches downloads and documents, quarantines suspicious files.

🌐 Network monitoring → flags unsafe connections and alerts the user.

🧠 AI layer → explains in plain language why something is suspicious and gives advice.
🚀 Roadmap
Proof-of-concept → basic agent with process and file monitoring.

Network module → detection of unsafe connections.

UI dashboard → clear interface for alerts and actions.

Social media agent → expand into digital workflows (post scheduling, spam filtering).

Agent Studio → a visual environment where anyone can build their own agent.
