# SafeAI-Agent
SafeAI-Agent: Open-source AI security assistant for home users. A transparent, privacy-first agent that monitors processes, files, and network activity to keep your PC safe.  Built for trust, collaboration, and community-driven innovation — because AI should empower people, not exploit them.
# 🔑 What SafeAI-Agent Does
- 🛡 **Process monitoring** → detects suspicious processes and can stop them.  
- 📂 **File monitoring** → watches downloads and documents, quarantines suspicious files.  
- 🌐 **Network monitoring** → flags unsafe connections and alerts the user.  
- 🧠 **AI layer** → explains in plain language why something is suspicious and gives advice.

## 🚀 Roadmap
1. **Proof-of-concept** → basic agent with process and file monitoring.  
2. **Network module** → detection of unsafe connections.  
3. **UI dashboard** → clear interface for alerts and actions.  
4. **Social media agent** → expand into digital workflows (post scheduling, spam filtering).  
5. **Agent Studio** → a visual environment where anyone can build their own agent.
